# Weekly Progress Reports
## Week 1
### Summary
This week, I started by doing some preliminary research into n-body simulations. I found that, depending on the number of bodies, there are various different techniques that can be used. I decided to attempt to implement two algorithms and began working on the simpler of the two that works for few-body problems.

To do this, I came up with a class structure and then implemented a physics engine that could approximate the movement of objects in discrete time intervals.

### Challenges
* Creating the open frameworks project: this caused issues with git as I was unsure of which files to push to my repository.
* Creating test cases: I was not able to compile my test for the OF application. This is something I aim to get working by the next code review.
