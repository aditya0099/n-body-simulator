# Project Proposal
## N-Body Problem Simulation and Visualization
### Background and Motivation
The n-body problem is a generalization of the famous but unsolvable three body problem in physics. The problem statement is as follows:
> Given a set of `n` bodies with fixed masses, initial positions and initial velocities that iteract gravitationally, describe the motion of these objects at any given future time.

The two-body version of this problem can be solved easily, but there is no general, closed-form solution for `n > 2`. The true motions of these bodies, however, can be accurately approximated through the use of computer simulations. Hence, n-body simulations are critical in allowing cosmologists and astrophysicists to model and predict the motion of complex celestial systems.
